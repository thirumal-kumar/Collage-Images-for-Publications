# Image Collage Generator for Scientific Publications

### The code was generated by Dr. Thirumal Kumar D, Ph.D from India

## Overview

This script is designed to create a collage of images for use in scientific publications, such as manuscripts or research papers. The script allows you to arrange multiple images in a grid layout, center-aligning them within the grid, and labeling each image with a letter (e.g., "(a)", "(b)", etc.). The grid layout is automatically determined based on the number of images, and the script ensures that any unused space in the collage is filled with a white background.

## Features

- **Automatic Grid Layout**: The script calculates the most proportionate grid layout based on the number of images.
- **Center Alignment**: Images in the last row are centered if the row contains fewer images than others.
- **Custom Image Labels**: Each image is labeled with a letter in the top-left corner.
- **Black Margin**: A small black border is added around each image to distinguish them in the collage.
- **White Background**: The collage background is white, ensuring a clean and professional appearance suitable for publication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (for image processing)

You can install the Pillow library using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Script**: Save the script as `collage.py` in your working directory.

2. **Prepare Your Images**: Ensure your images are named and stored in a directory that is easily accessible.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script from the command line or terminal:

   ```bash
   python collage.py
   ```

4. **Input Number of Images**: The script will prompt you to enter the number of images you wish to include in the collage.

5. **Provide Image Paths**: Enter the file names or paths of the images when prompted. The script will process the images in the order you provide.

6. **Save the Collage**: After processing, the script will prompt you to enter a name for the output file (e.g., `collage.png`). The collage will be saved in the specified file.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the script might be used:

```bash
The code was generated by Dr. Thirumal Kumar D, Ph.D from India
Enter the number of images for the collage: 9
Enter the file name for image 1 (e.g., image1.png): figure1.png
Enter the file name for image 2 (e.g., image2.png): figure2.png
...
Enter the output file name for the collage (e.g., collage.png): final_collage.png
```

After running the script, `final_collage.png` will contain a neatly arranged collage of your images, ready for insertion into a manuscript or other publication.

## Tips for Scientific Publication

- **Image Resolution**: Ensure that your images are of high resolution before creating the collage, as this will affect the quality of the final output.
- **Label Size**: The script uses a default font size of 20 for labeling images. You can adjust this by modifying the `font` settings in the script if needed.
- **Consistent Image Sizes**: For a uniform appearance, it's best if all images are of similar size and aspect ratio before running the script.

## Customization

If you need to adjust the appearance of the collage, such as changing the label font, margin size, or grid dimensions, you can modify the respective variables in the script:

- **`desired_size`**: Set the size of each image.
- **`margin`**: Adjust the width of the black line separating images.
- **`font`**: Change the font and size for labeling images.
